	<h1>Why do you need an About Us ?</h1>

	<p>So, people have landed on your site. They already saw the homepage where you introduce your blog, products, or services. Now they want to find more information about the person or people behind the products or services you offer. This is when they look for your “About Us” page – to know more about you! The page can go by different names – “About”, “Our story” – but their purpose is the same. To tell visitors who you are, and why they should choose your business!
   <br><br>
    When visitors first land on your site, you’re a stranger to them. Use this page to explain to them what it is that you do, and why you do it. They should be presented with clear information about you or your business.
   <br><br>
	Don’t think of this section as an obligation and only write a few paragraphs here and there. This is a wonderful opportunity for you to share your stories, values and build trust between you and your site visitors. When people know who you are, what you do, what you believe in, they are more likely to trust and do business with you.</p><br><br>
	<h1 style="width:900px;">What information should you include on your About Us ?</h1>
	<p>There are so many ways you can go about telling your company story. It’s tough to establish a one-size-fits-all structure for an About page. In general, try to think about what you want visitors to know about you, and what you think they want to know. In addition to that, your brand personality should speak loud and clear here. Let visitors know whom they are doing business with!
 	<br><br>
	The following list is just a suggestion of the various information you could have on your “About Us” page, regardless of the purpose of your website. You don’t need to include all of it on your page. Choose the information that you think is suitable for your business.</p>
